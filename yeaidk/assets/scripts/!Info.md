# Notes
## Collision Layers

## other things
- archer arrow drop: <br>![image with stuff](infoImages/imagev2.png)

# Todo
## big things
- spikes/hazards
- boss
- size limit
- map 
- pogo
- overhaul random get stage because its weird rn
## small things/cool tidbits that aren't important **yet**
- transfor collisions to be on the player (as opposed to the enemy.gd script)
- allow enemies to collide (What?)
## fixes
- fix the weirdness of the portal system (goes together with making a map)
  - basically, the portals do link, but if there are 2 adjacent ones (that would connect via portal or one would block the other), they don't interact
- janky spear col (only butt now)
- some weird slash bug?

# Questions to ask people
- file structure
  - do I need to do SubVP for what I'm doing
  - should I have multiple HUDS for each thing? -> HUD, stageSelect, pause
  - weapon has scrip
- general abstraction/layout questions
